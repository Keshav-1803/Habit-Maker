You can add new habits by filling out the form in the `InputHabits` component. Enter the action you want to perform, the motivation behind it, where you plan to do it, the date, and time.

### Viewing Habits

All your added habits are displayed in a list in the `HabitsShow` component. You can see the action, motivation, environment, date, and time for each habit.

### Deleting Habits

If you want to remove a habit, simply click the "Delete" button next to it in the list. You can also clear all habits at once by using the "Clean All Habits" button in the `InputHabits` component.

## Components

### App

The main `App` component serves as the entry point of the application. It manages the state of habits using React's `useState` hook.

### InputHabits

The `InputHabits` component is responsible for rendering the form where users can add new habits. It includes input fields for action, motivation, environment, date, and time. Users can submit the form to add a new habit or clear all habits.

### HabitsShow

The `HabitsShow` component displays the list of added habits. It includes a table with columns for Sr. No, Action, Motivation, Environment, Date, Time, and a "Delete" button for each habit.
